<h1>BXR-STAY FIT</h1>
</form>
<div class="para1">Fitness in London has become a way of life. A pair of Lucas Hugh or Lululemon leggings are designed and made with the same level of detail, precision and consideration of aesthetics as any designer jeans. A single class and a smoothie can cost the same as drinks out with a friend and more urbanites are eschewing that cocktail for a sweat session. BXR, one of the latest high-end fitness facilities to open in London, is leading the way. Set in Marylebone, itâ€™s a spectacular 12,000-square-foot space, with two floors and considerable six-metre-high ceilings. Where BXR truly moves the dial is on its fitness offering: it's a boxing gym. World champion Anthony Joshua trains there, as do Victoria Secret models. That balance of grit, athletic authenticity and ultra luxury is not easy to achieve. Here you will find handmade backlit mirrors in the changing rooms, design cues inspired by Bottega Veneta handbags, custom-made braided leather ropes snaking from the ceilings and members can cosset their hands in made-t0-measure Di Nardo boxing gloves while in the ring. Herein we spoke with BXR CEO Olia Sardarova and Marie Soliman, co-founder of Bergman Interiors who designed the inimitable space.</div>
<h2>FOR BOTH MEN & WOMEN TRIAL FROM $ 30 </h2>
<h4>A gym is a building or room where people go to exercise and get fit. Gyms can also include outdoor areas and may have courts for sports like basketball, hockey, tennis, boxing, or wrestling. Gyms are equipped with machines and weights to help people build muscle, improve their fitness, and increase their overall well-being. 
The word "gym" is short for "gymnasium," which comes from the Greek word gymnasion meaning "public place where exercises are practiced". In Ancient Greece, men often exercised naked at the gym, which is reflected in the root word gymnazein, meaning "to train naked". Today, people typically wear shorts or sweatpants to the gym. 
For a gym to be high quality, it's important that the facility is clean and well-maintained. This includes:
Sweeping and mopping the gym floor daily and cleaning it thoroughly at least once a week
Repairing damage to the floor in a timely manner
Recoating sports floors annually
Keeping the entire facility, including bathrooms and locker rooms, clean and ready for use
Regularly inspecting equipment and repairing or replacing it as needed.
